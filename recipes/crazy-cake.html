        <h3>Delicious chocolate crazy cake!</h3>
        <p> <strong>Crazy cake </strong> is an easy homemade cake recipe that became
             popular during the depression era. It has no eggs,
              no milk and no butter. And to make
             it even simpler, you mix the cake ingredients right in 
             the <em>baking pan </em>. That's right…no extra dishes!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients for Chocolate Buttercream Frosting:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>powdered sugar</li>
            <li>cocoa powder</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>vanilla</li>
            <li>heavy cream</li>
        </ul>  

        <h4>Instructions for Chocolate Buttercream Frosting</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>You'll whip the butter for about 1 ½ minutes 
                until it is creamy and whitish in color.</li>
            <li>Then you'll add the salt and vanilla.</li>
            <li>And then comes the powdered sugar and cocoa 
                powder. Add this in slowly and be sure 
                the mixer is on low speed so the powdered 
                sugar doesn't go flying all over your kitchen.</li>
            <li>Add a tablespoon of heavy cream at a time 
                until the frosting is the consistency that you'd like it.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to beat the frosting too much. It will whip more air into your frosting.</li>
