            <li>Fill a medium saucepan with water to a depth of 1 inch. Fit
                 saucepan with steamer basket, and bring water to a boil

                Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Cut hard-cooked eggs in half lengthwise,
                 and scoop out yolks into a medium bowl. 
                Add sour cream, salt, pepper, garlic powder,
                 and onion powder to yolks; stir until mixture is fully combined and smooth.</li>
            <li>Spoon yolk mixture into a zip-top plastic bag, 
                and cut off ½-inch from one of the corners.
                 Pipe yolk mixture evenly into the cavity of each egg white half. </li>
            <li>Place egg halves on a serving platter, and sprinkle evenly
                 with cooked bacon, chips, Cheddar, and chives.
