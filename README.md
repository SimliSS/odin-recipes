# odin-recipes
My First Odin Project!
Designing a recipes website.
Skills I would have demonstrated after completing this project include: Setting up a web page boilerplate in a correct form, using the appropiate HTML tags, opening and closing of tags, including absolute and relative links and inserting images.
